            <p>There is no age limit to learn and become a web developer.This is what lit the coding spark!.Due to the
                latest economic crisis, I found myself jobless so I started a part-time job. During my free time, I
                decided to learn a bit of html, css, and javascript thanks to online courses. I also looked at tutorials
                about android programming (xml and java).
